: Write an x86 code to find the Y component of a circle of radius 120 pixels :
Y =   √(R2− X2)
(a) When the program is run, the following message should be displayed ;
This code is written by Ekrem Demir.
Enter an integer between 0 and 120, as X-pixel value :
(b) Upon entering the integer, the program should check the integer and exit the program with
another message,
Entered integer is not between 0 and 120 !
and upon pressing a key, the program should halt.
(c) When the program is run and if the integer is correct, then the program should calculate the
Y-pixel value (integer) on a circle of radius R (defined as a constant with a value 120 in the
code) by using the following equation :
Y-pixel value is = <integer>
and upon pressing one more key ....
(d) the program should calculate all set of X values from 0 to 120 store corresponding Yvalues
into the memory locations starting with 0800:0000 (for example Y value for X=0
should be stored at 0800:0000, Y value for X=1 should be stored at 0800:0001 ... etc) and
upon completion the calculation, the program should halt with an ending message
