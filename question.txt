Consider 16 angles 5,10,15,20,.. 35,40,50,55..,85 in degrees. Note that
angles 0,45,90 are omitted. Write x86 assembly code (and draw its flowchart onto the
next slide) to find radian values (up to the second digit following the decimal point)
and store into the memory with the following format:
-Each degree angle (5,10,15,20,.. 35,40,50,55..,85) will be stored in hex values into
the addresses starting from the logical address 0700:0000 to 0700:000F;
-The integer values of equivalent radian angles should be stored in the memory
locations 0700:0010 to 0700:001F, in ASCII code with the same order;
-First digit after the decimal point of equivalent radian angles should be stored in the
memory locations 0700:0020 to 0700:002F, in ASCII code with the same order;
-Second digit after the decimal point of equivalent radian angles should be stored in
the memory locations 0700:0030 to 0700:003F, in ASCII code with the same order;
Note that you should do mathematical calculation to convert from degrees to radians,
you may not write certain numbers to associated memory addresses.
